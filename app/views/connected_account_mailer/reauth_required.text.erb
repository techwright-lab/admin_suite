Action Required: Reconnect Your Gmail Account
============================================= Hi
<%= @user.name.present? ? @user.name : 'there' %>, We were unable to sync your
Gmail account (<%= @account.email %>) because your connection has expired. This
can happen for a few reasons: - Your Google account password was changed - You
revoked access to Gleania from your Google account settings - The connection
hasn't been used in a while Don't worry, your data is safe! To resume syncing
interview-related emails, you'll need to reconnect your Gmail account.
Reconnect your account at: <%= settings_url(tab: "integrations") %> Why is this
important? Keeping your Gmail connected helps Gleania automatically detect and
track interview-related emails, so you never miss an important update about
your job applications. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out! Best
regards, The Gleania Team
